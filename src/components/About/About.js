        <p>
          My name is Alex Nelson and I'm currently a Senior in Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University with an
          expected graduation of May 2019. I love to code and have 2+ years of Software Engineering
          experience specializing in Full-Stack web development. <br/><br/>

          Iâ€™ve held Software Engineering internships with <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/">BamSEC</a>, <a href="https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/">The Walt Disney Company</a>,
          and <a href="https://www.evvemi.com/">EVVEMI Inc.</a> doing Software Engineering in a variety of fields. I plan on working at
          <a href="https://www.compass.com/">Compass Real Estate</a> as a Software Engineer
          following my graduation in May 2019. <br/><br/>

          I love using new technologies like React, Gulp.js, Django and more! These are just a few of my favorites
          for getting a project up and running. I've recently started deploying sites on Firebase for static content
          and Heroku when I need a more robust backend. <br/><br/>

          In my free time, I love to travel, play chess, exercise, and hangout with
          friends and family.
